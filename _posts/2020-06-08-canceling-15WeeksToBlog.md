Hey there!  I've decided to cancel #15WeeksToBlog challenge I set for myself to
stay motivated to blog more often. I started it whilst the
#100DaysToBlog / #100DaysToOffload challenges trended on mastodon, knowing very
well that I don't want additional incentives for spending time in front of a
screen __daily__ and writing something supposedly "offloading". The
spirit pushed me towards reviving my own blog though and I tried the weekly
blog post to find a fitting level between regular posts and the time and
resources to give them enough depth so I don't see them as irrelevant and "just
another guys random thoughts on the internet". I've steadily but slowly been
working on blog posts since then, but time is even more sparse than I expected
(between the covid19-pandemic related inconveniences, some contract work,
searching for a more permanent job, arriving and furnishing the new apartment
and taking care of three kids bustling around the home), so weekly and even
bi-weekly posts is nothing I can commit to right now.

There's more posts about Nix and NixOS in the pipeline and I also want to
document my recent encounters building a small multi-apartment network based on
OpenWRT enabled hardware. They'll be published when they're done. Might be next
week, but could just as well be next month. So give this blog an occasional
visit or subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) if you're interested in those
topics. Thanks!
