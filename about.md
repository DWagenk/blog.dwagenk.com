I'm an embedded systems software engineer living in LÃ¼neburg, Germany.

I like to dive into projects and learn as I go. Self teaching, sometimes
accompanied by having good mentors, is really the best way for me to learn
something new. Besides tinkering with electronics and writing drivers and
applications, I like bicycles, family-time and repairing broken stuff or
extending it's usefulness in other ways.
